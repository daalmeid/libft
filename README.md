# libft
Libft is a project based on rewriting a number of functions belonging to libc. The objective here
is not to reinvent the wheel! It is meant to allow us to learn **how** these functions work and
basic algorithm implementation. Besides these functions, we were asked to code a few more functions
that will prove to be useful in the future.

## How to use it:

To create that library, follow these steps:

	git clone https://github.com/daalmeid/libft.git
	cd libft
	make (to include functions applied to lists, run "make bonus" instead)
  You should create a file called **libft.a** and be able to use it in your compilation.
